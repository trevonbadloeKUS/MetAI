At the **MetaAI Lab** at **Korea University - Sejong Campus** we research the convergence of **next-generation optical devices and systems** using **metamaphotonics (MetA)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. Metamaterials are engineered to manipulate the optical properties of light at the subwavelength scale - *beyond* what is possible in nature.

## Metaphotonics

The field of metaphotonics combines metamaterials - artifical materials with unique optical properties - and photonics - the study and application of light - to create groundbreaking new ways to manipulate electromagnetic waves. With the potential to bring science fiction to reality, metaphotonics promises to transform conventional bulky optical devices into flat metasurfaces.
