At the **MetaAI Lab** at **Korea University - Sejong Campus** we research the convergence of **next-generation optical devices and systems** using **metaphotonics (Meta)** and **artificial intelligence (AI)**. Metamaterials are engineered to manipulate the optical properties of light at the subwavelength scale - ***beyond what is possible in nature***.

## Metaphotonics

The field of metaphotonics combines **metamaterials** - artifical materials with unique optical properties - and **photonics** - the study and application of light - to create groundbreaking new ways to manipulate electromagnetic waves. With the potential to bring **science fiction to reality**, metaphotonics promises to transform conventional bulky optical devices into **flat metasurfaces**.
